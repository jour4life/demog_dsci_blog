      <description>Welcome to my blog! I am a demographer who loves working with data and emerging data science tools.
I decided to start this blog for a couple of reasons. The first is for me to document social science topics, statistical techniques, and data science tools I am interested in. The second reason is to help people like me learn about the potential and utility of data and techniques available without having to start from scratch.</description>

      <description>I earned my PhD in Applied Demography from the University of Texas at San Antonio (2013). I also hold an MS and BA in Sociology from the University of Texas at San Antonio (2010) and University of Texas at Austin (2004) respectively.
During my graduate studies, I worked on projects related to various social issues, including: homelessness and inequality, residential energy consumption, and demography (fertility and migration). During this time, I acquired a great passion for analytics, especially using programming and mapping.</description>
