      <description>I want to thank people in the R community for everything they do to, such as creating new packages and platforms for people to share their ideas to the world. I am really grateful to people like Yihui who created blogdown and bookdown. I can&amp;rsquo;t say enough of how blogdown has changed the way I document and communicate analyses with others&amp;hellip;and with such ease!
I started using blogdown a couple of weeks ago and I can&amp;rsquo;t believe how easy it has been using blogdown to install hugo, write a post, and publish all in one place.</description>

      <description>In the previous post, I looked at changes in household income and housing values between 2007 and 2016. The reason for looking at these changes was due to a recent post provided by the US Census Bureau that stated San Antonio added the most residents between 2016 and 2017.
San Antonio, as much of Texas, experienced increased net in-migration since the Great Recession (2008). As a result, I wondered how these changes in population could have affected housing values.</description>

      <description>My hometown of San Antonio added the most residents than any other city in the country between 2016 and 2017 (link). Since 2007, the population in San Antonio and surrounding areas have grown rapidly. One of the questions I have is, how have recent changes impacted housing values in the area during this time? How has household income fared in comparison? These questions are important because rapid changes in population can put a strain on the housing supply, which can lead to drastic increasing housing values due to a limited housing supply.</description>
