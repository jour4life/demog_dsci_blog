I earned my PhD in Applied Demography from the University of Texas at San Antonio (2013). I also hold an MS and BA in Sociology from the University of Texas at San Antonio (2010) and University of Texas at Austin (2004) respectively.

During my graduate studies, I worked on projects related to various social issues, including: homelessness and inequality, residential energy consumption, and demography (fertility and migration). During this time, I acquired a great passion for analytics, especially using programming and mapping. I am now on a mission to empower small business owners and entrepreneurs and help them learn about the various demographic and analytical tools they can use to better understand their customers and overall business activity through data.

When not working and learning about analytical tools, I enjoy reading about entrepreneurship and love going on hikes with my beautiful wife and daughters.
