I want to thank people in the R community for everything they do to, such as creating new packages and platforms for people to share their ideas to the world. I am really grateful to people like [Yihui](https://yihui.name/en/) who created blogdown and bookdown. I can't say enough of how blogdown has changed the way I document and communicate analyses with others...and with such ease! 

I started using blogdown a couple of weeks ago and I can't believe how easy it has been using blogdown to install hugo, write a post, and publish all in one place. Of course there are some initial steps to overcome, but luckily there's Yihui's [book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and several tutorials (especially [this](https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/) one!) that make it easy to get started.

Like I said, I just started using blogdown and already have three (now four) posts up. In the second and third posts, I analyzed data from the American Community Survey (ACS) to observe changes in households, housing units, household income, and housing unit values. Really, I analyzed those data mainly to get started with blogdown and see how easy it can be to write and publish a blog. I'm excited and interested seeing what new things I'll learn from both programming and demographic data perspectives.
