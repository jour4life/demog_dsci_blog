Welcome to my blog! I am a demographer who loves working with data and emerging data science tools. 

I decided to start this blog for a couple of reasons. The first is for me to document social science topics, statistical techniques, and data science tools I am interested in. The second reason is to help people like me learn about the potential and utility of data and techniques available without having to start from scratch. 

I use this blog as a platform to write about various topics related to social science, data, and programming. In the process, I give examples of gathering public data, such as those from the US Census (or other government sources) and analyzing them with open source data science tools, such as R, Python, and QGIS. Ultimately, the goal is to provide a source of information for people seeking to learn about what is readily available and what they can do to answer questions and/or make data-driven decisions. 

Thanks for stopping by! I really look forward to writing and engaging with guests so that we may learn together.
