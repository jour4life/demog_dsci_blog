QGIS is great option for producing maps. One can create maps by downloading shapefiles and opening them in QGIS.

In this exercise, I downloaded a shapefile of all blockgroups in Texas from the U.S. Census Bureau ([link](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html)). The file is a geodatabase and contains some sociodemographic data.

Drag the geodatabase to QGIS and a dialogue box will open

Done!

In the next post, I will show h.ow to select a subset of block groups, specifically those located in Bexar County
